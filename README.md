# codeRefactor
homework  6/15
I updated this html and css code for optimization. I changed the header div and footer div to their semantic elements. I adjusted the nav bar and items. I combined redundant css properties where possible including the universal and class elements, such as the groups of images with exact desired attributes. I added alt tags to the images and removed any unneccessary lines in html and css that i noticed.
